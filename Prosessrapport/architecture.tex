This section describes the tools we have used to solve the assignment. 

\subsection{Whoosh 2.0}
Whoosh is a library written in Python to support fast indexing and searching of text collections. The library provides high performance, multifunctional queries and support for scoring algorithms.

\subsection{Stop words}
We achieved to find a Norwegian stop word list, which we needed in order to make the indexing work as intended.
